# VMware Information

VMware is a virtual machine solution that lets you run multiple virtual machines on your computer. For the purposes of our course, VMware also offers another important and useful feature - the ability to create virtual networks on your system that you can connect your VMs to.

You will need to have VMware installed for this course. The instructions in this document will help you get everything going.

1. **Download VMware from the OneDrive share link on the D2L site.** It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

    > Mac users: At this time VMware for Mac only allows you to run virtual machines that are compiled for the ARM CPU architecture when it is running on an Apple Silicon Mac (late 2020 or later, with an "M" chip). I have made every effort to try to make the experience in this course as similar as possible for both Mac and Windows users, but there will be at the least some cosmetic differences in the two VMware applications, and there may be some additional technical considerations as well.

2. **Install the VMware software.**

    * On PC, run the EXE and simply work through the installation process - when asked to enter a license key, you should see the option for "free personal use".
    * On Mac, mount the image and copy the VMware Fusion program into your Applications folder and run it. Similarly, you should be able to indicate that you are using VMware for personal use and thus can skip entering a license key.

3. Proceed to the assignment instructions!

## Testing VMware

To test your VMware installation, you can boot a Linux "live" CD to ensure your VM setup is working properly.

You'll do this as part of Individual Assignment 1.
