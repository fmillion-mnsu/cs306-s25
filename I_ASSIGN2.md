# Individual Assignment 2 - Configuring Port Forwarding

This exercise will involve setting up **port forwarding**. This allows you to configure a specific machine inside of your private LAN that is accessible from the public facing Internet side of your router. 

If you have ever set up a game server, web site or other server on a computer at home and have needed to figure out how to log in to your router to "forward a port", you will find this process very familiar - it's the same process. However, we'll be doing it with our virtual network.

To start with this assignment, power on both your router and client VMs.

1. In the client VM, open the IPFire web interface. (Reminder: it's at https://<router_ip>:444 - accept the security warning.)
